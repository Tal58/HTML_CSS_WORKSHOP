## ABSTRACT OF TAL58 GITHUB  🌄

🌲This file shows the list of all repository files.

🔗 Also the repository files show the evolution of my capabilities.

🐍  ++You can easily understand how methods/design/built-in functions work in any study.

👨‍💻 If you get stuck 🐛 or try to learn more examples, one of the repos will help you to find a better way on the long FS path.

📨 If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

## Objective 🎯 

🏇 I hope that the repository files will be open permanently and I will regularly add more practical examples. To get more information please follow my account.
